==================================================
#### Draft
  - use `Flutter Intl` extension in vscode. 
  - run `initialize` command to define locals.
  - run `add local` to add ar language
  - add  `delegates`, `global-localization` and `support-localization` to Material Design.
  - add `keywords` in generated files for english and arabic
  - use the `keywords` instead of hardcoded text strings
  - at the current step, change language will be manually by changing the language from Material Design....in next will using `state-management`.
